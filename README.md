## GETTING INTO THE PROJECT:

Hospital Management System in php . This system has a ‘Home’ page from where the patient, doctor & administrator can login into their accounts by toggling the tabs accordingly. Fig 1.1 shows the ‘Home’ page of our project.

'About Us' page (Fig 1.2) allows us to get some more information about the quality and the services of the hospital.

‘Contact’ page allows users to provide feedback or queries about the services of the hospital. Fig 1.3 shows the ‘Contact’ page.

The ‘Home’ page consists of 3 modules:

1. Patient Module
2. Doctor Module
3. Admin Module

4. Implementation of pagination for all the list view across the application.
5. Addition of more fields in the prescription statement to make it more specific one.
